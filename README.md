<h1>EARTH_ROTATIONSPEED_CALCULATOR<h1/><br>
<p>The Earth Rotation Speed Calculator is designed to compute the tangential speed of Earth's surface at different latitudes. This calculator utilizes the user's geographic location to determine the latitude and, based on that, calculates how fast the Earth is rotating at that point.
